Job Description

from odesk.com


I need a program that takes TWO to FIVE inputs and returns them in all possible orders. 

SO 

For input A, B, C the return would be: 

A B C 
C B A 
A C B 
C A B 
B A C 
B C A 
A B 
B A 
A C 
C A 
B C 
C B 
A 
B 
C 

This should work with any string of words, so instead of A B C we have 

Machine Great Buy 

So it would return 

Great Buy Machine 
Great Machine Buy 
Etc...
